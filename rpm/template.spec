%description
cpp_common contains C++ code for doing things that are not necessarily ROS
related, but are useful for multiple packages. This includes things like the
ROS_DEPRECATED and ROS_FORCE_INLINE macros, as well as code for getting
backtraces. This package is a component of roscpp.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
